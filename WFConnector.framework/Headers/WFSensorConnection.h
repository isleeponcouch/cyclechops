/**
 * Represents the connection for an ANT sensor.
 *
 * The WFSensorConnection is the entry point for dealing with an ANT sensor.
 * Once the instance is obtained (via WFHardwareConnector::requestSensorConnection:),
 * it can be used to determine connection state, disconnect, or retrieve data.
 *
 * The pairing procedure is as follows:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Create a new WFConnectionParams instance</li>
 * <li>Specify the WFConnectionParams::sensorType but do not specify any
 * devices.  This will specify a wildcard search.</li>
 * <li>When specifying a wildcard search, optionally set the
 * WFConnectionParams::networkType to limit the search to a specific network.</li>
 * <li>Invoke the WFHardwareConnector::requestSensorConnection: method.</li>
 * <li>The WFSensorConnectionDelegate::connection:stateChanged: method will be
 * invoked when the connection is established.</li>
 * <li>Confirm that the WFSensorConnection::isConnected property is <c>TRUE</c>.</li>
 * <li>Store the WFSensorConnection::deviceNumber,
 * WFSensorConnection::transmissionType,  WFSensorConnection::networkType
 * adn WFSensorConnection::deviceUUIDString values for future connections to this
 * sensor.</li>
