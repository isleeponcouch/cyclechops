 * The WFBikePowerData combines the most commonly used of this data into a single 
 * entity.  The data represents the latest of each data type sent from the sensor.
 *
 * @note As of 2.3.0 all the old properties for WFBikePowerData have been deprecated
 * in order to replaced them with new properties that apply to both ANT+ and BTLE
 * sensors. The old properties will remain to work with ANT+ sensors but will not
 * return any data when using a BTLE power sensor. It is recomend that you move
