/**
 * Gets or sets a boolean value indicating whether sensor connections are reset
 * automatically when the fisica hardware is disconnected.
 *
 * When the fisica hardware is disconnected (either by removing physically, or by
 * the application entering background mode in pre-iOS5 devices), the ANT radio
 * loses power, and the established connections are broken.  When the fisica is
 * re-connected, if <c>autoReset</c> is <c>TRUE</c>, any WFSensorConnection
 * instances established prior to the disconnect are reset, and the
 * WFHardwareConnector is in initialized state.  If <c>autoReset</c> is <c>FALSE</c>,
 * any WFSensorConnection instances will attempt to re-establish previous
 * connections.  In most cases, this should restore the connection and resume the
 * data flow.  However, there may be possible data synchronization issues in some
 * situations.  Therefore, it is recommended that the <c>autoReset</c> remain in
 * the default <c>TRUE</c> condition, and that the application re-estabish desired
 * connections in the same manner as when the WFHardwareConnector is originally
 * initialized.
 *
 * @note The default value is <c>TRUE</c>.
