/**
 * Represents the data available from the BTLE Bike Speed and Cadence sensor.
 *
 * BTLE sensors send data in multiple packets.  The WFBTLEBikeSpeedCadenceData
 * combines the most commonly used of this data into a single entity.  The data
 * represents the latest of each data type sent from the sensor.
 *
 * @note The WFBTLEBikeSpeedCadenceData is an extension of the WFBikeSpeedCadenceData
 * class.  This class is specific to the data available from the BTLE speed and
 * cadence sensors.  Much of the data is the same as that available from the
 * ANT+ speed and cadence sensors.  The Wahoo Fitness Speed and Cadence sensors
 * provide data beyond that specified by the BTLE CSC profile.  This data is
 * available through the WFBTLEBikeSpeedCadenceData::wahooData property.  If the
 * connected sensor is a non-Wahoo sensor, this data is not available.
